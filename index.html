			Dez Mears is a staple of the Bronx Vegan Bazaar. His recipes are heavenly to the senses, including small plates 
			featuring scallion mac and cheese with coconut rice, peas, curry cabbage and smoked jerk jackfruit. 
			He also offers szechuan jackfruit with broccoli, fried rice and ackee – a Caribbean plant that mimics eggs.<br><br>

			“I wouldn’t sell anything I wouldn’t eat,” Mears proudly proclaimed. “It’s about putting love in the food.”<br><br>

			The Bronx is the most food insecure borough in New York City and one of the most food insecure areas in the United States. 
			Additionally, the South Bronx has roughly 18-25 bodegas per one supermarket, which means access to fresh produce is limited.<br><br>

			That's where the Bronx Vegan Bazaar comes in, along with the nearly 30 farmer's markets in the borough.
