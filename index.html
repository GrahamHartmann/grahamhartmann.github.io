			<h1>The Bronx Fights Food Insecurity With Farmer's Markets</h1>

			<b>By Graham Hartmann</b>
			<b>December 11, 2023</b><br><br>

			Dez Mears is a staple of the Bronx Vegan Bazaar. His recipes are heavenly to the senses, including small plates 
			featuring scallion mac and cheese with coconut rice, peas, curry cabbage and smoked jerk jackfruit. 
			He also offers szechuan jackfruit with broccoli, fried rice and ackee – a Caribbean plant that mimics eggs.<br><br>

			“I wouldn’t sell anything I wouldn’t eat,” Mears proudly proclaimed. “It’s about putting love in the food.”<br><br>

			Healthy food can be difficult to come by in the South Bronx. The Bronx is the most food insecure borough in New York City 
			and one of the most food insecure areas in the United States. Additionally, the South Bronx has roughly 18-25 bodegas per 
			one supermarket, which means access to fresh produce is limited.<br><br>
			
			That's where the Bronx Vegan Bazaar comes in, along with 
			the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/DOHMH-Farmers-Markets-Map-/fi97-k4k6">nearly 30 farmer's markets</a> in the borough.
			These fresh markets are helping combat the Bronx's reputation as a food desert. In fact, apart from Manhattan, the Bronx has the most
			farmer's markets per capita than any other borough in New York City.
